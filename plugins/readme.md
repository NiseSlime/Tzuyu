# PLUGINS ARE HERE

### Quickstart

Place your plugin in a folder (named with camelCase format) and have a file with PascalCase in the directory

For example, if your plugin name is `SamplePlugin`, there would be a folder named `samplePlugin`, and within it would be a file called `SamplePlugin.js`

Ensure that your plugin `module.exports = <ClassNameHere>` and extends `Plugin` in this directory
